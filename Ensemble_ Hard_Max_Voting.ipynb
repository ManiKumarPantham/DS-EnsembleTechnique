    "Business Problem: There are a lot of assumptions in the diagnosis pertaining to cancer. In a few cases radiologists, pathologists and oncologists go wrong in diagnosing whether tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Hence team of physicians want us to build an AI application which will predict with confidence the presence of cancer in a patient. This will serve as a compliment to the physicians.\n",
